# TODO

- Decide whether to refresh `config/git/allowed_signers` with current SSH signing keys or skip the step entirely.
- Change the shell prompt on servers and macOS installs.
- Fix the Docker installation step.
- Backport the modern tools (`eza`, etc.) to the apt-based package list.
- Fill in `packages/linux/postinstall/codex.sh` with the actual installer when available.
- Smoke-test the bootstrap flow on macOS, Ubuntu, and Raspberry Pi before merging.
- Add colors and some style
- Need to make sure we set ZSH as default shell

- Check that we did not lose anything from prior mac config
