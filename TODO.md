# TODO

- Change the shell prompt on servers and macOS installs.
- Backport the modern tools (`eza`, etc.) to the apt-based package list.
- Smoke-test the bootstrap flow on macOS, Ubuntu, and Raspberry Pi before merging.
- Need to make sure we set ZSH as default shell

- Check that we did not lose anything from prior mac config
